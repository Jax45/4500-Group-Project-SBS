      A small brown dog jumped over a yellow box. Then, he made his way through a stream. He didn’t like the water. Eventually, he found his way to a new home on the edge of the forest. He couldn’t believe what he’d found there. A food bowl, a water bowl, as many toys as he could imagine.       There was a person there, too. Was it his person? Was he their dog? He couldn’t remember. They had so many bowls! They had to have had another dog at some point. Or maybe he was their dog? No, it couldn't be. He had a combined bowl. A food and water bowl.
